## Ingredients

### For the spice blend
- 1 tablespoon garam masala
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1.5 teaspoons sea salt
- 1 teaspoon coriander
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)

### For the tikka masala
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil (optional, if sautéing )
- 1 yellow onion
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ginger, grated (I use store-bought paste to- save time)
- 3 cups white or yellow potato, diced
- 2 cups tomato purée (Also called strained crushed- tomatoes. Plain old crushed tomatoes work, too.)
- 1 19oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 14oz can fire-roasted tomatoes
- 1 cup frozen peas
- 1 red, yellow or orange bell pepper, diced
- 1 jalapeño pepper, diced
- 3/4 cup cashews, soaked and rinsed
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice, freshly squeezed

## Instructions
1. Make the spice blend: Add all ingredients to a small bowl and stir until well combined. Set aside.
2. Heat coconut oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Sauté the onion until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and continue to sauté for another 30 seconds, until fragrant. Transfer mixture to the slow cooker.
3. Add the potato, chickpeas, green peas, bell pepper, jalapeño, tomato purée, fire-roasted tomatoes and spice blend to the slow cooker. Mix until ingredients are evenly distributed, then set the slow cooker to cook on High for 4 hours.
4. While the tikka masala is slow cooking, place cashews in a bowl of water and set aside. A few minutes before the slow cooker is done, drain and rinse the cashews. Place the cashews in a high speed blender with 3/4 cup fresh water and blend until smooth and creamy.
5. Once the slow cooker is done, add the cashew cream and lemon juice and stir until well combined. If needed, add salt to taste. Serve immediately with basmati rice or naan. 

## Notes
1. Sautéing the onion, garlic and ginger is an optional step. It adds great depth of flavour, but you can skip this step and still get a great result. 
2. The potatoes should be fully cooked after 4 hours, but if you like your potatoes on the softer side, you can increase the time up to 5 hours.
3. If you don’t have a high-speed blender or would rather not use cashews, you can substitute a 15oz can of coconut milk for the cashew cream. Add the coconut milk before slow cooking. 
4. Store in the refrigerator and consume within 4 days, or freeze for up to 4 months. 
5. Nutrition estimate is only for the tikka masala (no rice or naan).
