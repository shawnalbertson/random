Serves 6

## Ingredients
### Main
- 2 blocks tofu
- 4 tbsp cornstarch
- 4 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 red bell pepper, cubed
- 1 green bell pepper, cubed
- 1 bunch green onions
- 1 cup cashews/ peanuts
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger
- 6 garlic cloves
- 10 whole dried red chili peppers

### Kung Pao Sauce
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/3 cup rice vinegar
- 2 tbsp sugar

## Method
1. Place two paper towels on a plate. Put the entire block of tofu (drained from its packaging liquid) onto the paper towels. Place two more paper towels on top of the tofu then place a heavy item on top of it. Not so heavy as to crush the tofu, just heavy enough to squeeze out the liquid. “Drain” the tofu for 30 minutes, changing the paper towels half way through.
2. Make the Kung Pao sauce: combine soy sauce, rice vinegar and sugar in a bowl. Stir to combine and set aside.
3. Once the tofu is done draining, slice it into 1-inch cubes and place them in a large bowl. Sprinkle with cornstarch and gently toss with your hands, until they are all coated.
4. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the sesame oil over high heat. Working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan, stir-fry half of the tofu until all 4 sides are lightly browned. About 15 minutes total. Remove the tofu from the pan, onto a paper towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining tofu.
5. Once all of the tofu is cooked, use the same skillet to finish the dish. Heat one tablespoon of sesame oil over medium heat. When the pan is hot, stir-fry the bell peppers until they begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the green onions, cashews, ginger, garlic, and dried chili peppers. Stir-fry the vegetables for two minutes before adding the Kung Pao sauce and the fried tofu. Bring everything in the pan to a simmer, and cook until the sauce has thickened— about 2 minutes.
6. Serve over white or brown rice. Enjoy!
